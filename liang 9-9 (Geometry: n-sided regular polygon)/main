/*(Geometry: n-sided regular polygon) In an n-sided regular polygon, all sides
have the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is
both equilateral and equiangular). Design a class named RegularPolygon that
contains:
■ A private int data field named n that defines the number of sides in the polygon with default value 3.
■ A private double data field named side that stores the length of the side with
default value 1.
■ A private double data field named x that defines the x-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
■ A private double data field named y that defines the y-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
■ A no-arg constructor that creates a regular polygon with default values.
■ A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides
and length of side, centered at (0, 0).
■ A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides,
length of side, and x- and y-coordinates.
■ The accessor and mutator methods for all data fields.
■ The method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the polygon.
■ The method getArea() that returns the area of the polygon. The formula for
computing the area of a regular polygon is Area =
n * s2
4 * tan¢ pn ≤.
Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
program that creates three RegularPolygon objects, created using the no-arg
constructor, using RegularPolygon(6, 4), and using RegularPolygon(10,
4, 5.6, 7.8). For each object, display its perimeter and area.*/

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RegularPolygon rp1=new RegularPolygon();
        RegularPolygon rp2=new RegularPolygon(6, 4);
        RegularPolygon rp3=new  RegularPolygon(10, 4, 5.6, 7.8);
        System.out.println("the perimeter and area of the first polygon are "+rp1.getPerimeter()+" and "+rp1.getArea());
        System.out.println("the perimeter and area of the second polygon are "+rp2.getPerimeter()+" and "+rp2.getArea());
        System.out.println("the perimeter and area of the third polygon are "+rp3.getPerimeter()+" and "+rp3.getArea());
