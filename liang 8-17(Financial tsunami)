//this q is a page long im not putting it here :/ its on page 312
//basiclly you are given a graph of banks that says how much they loan each other and their balance,you are also given a limit
//the total assetes of a bank are its balance+the money it has lenden to other if the total assets are under the limit that bank is unsafe
//and cannot pay back its loan which means the other bank that have loaned to it may also be unsafe. you have to see which banks are unsafe
